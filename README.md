- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cliffuu!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about data science, software development, and ideally cybersecurity in the future! I also really enjoy ecology, especially anything related to birds, and gaming!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and practicing it. I'll be posting all the projects I do on here, so as to get a lot of practice and ideally feedback on them as well!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: cliftoncooper9771@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/They, but I'm fine with any pronouns really. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Hamerkops make the biggest nests of all the birds. They are dorky little birds and I love them!
